# AccuLynx Contacts

Just a quick coding assessment. Emphasis on quick--I'm going to have to cop to there being a TS warning on building for production with a certain fieldset on the "Add" view.

### Note
I left the default Vue-create homepage and about page just to have some links to actually click through and see the header overlap.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```
